      <!-- Load the published .nexe.  This includes the 'nacl' attribute which
      shows how to load multi-architecture modules.  Each entry in the "nexes"
      object in the .nmf manifest file is a key-value pair: the key is the
      instruction set architecture ('x86-32', 'x86-64', etc.); the value is a URL
      for the desired NaCl module.
      To load the debug versions of your .nexes, set the 'nacl' attribute to the
      _dbg.nmf version of the manifest file.

      Note: Since this NaCl module does not use any real-estate in the browser,
      it's width and height are set to 0.

      Note: The <EMBED> element is wrapped inside a <DIV>, which has both a 'load'
      and a 'message' event listener attached.  This wrapping method is used
      instead of attaching the event listeners directly to the <EMBED> element to
      ensure that the listeners are active before the NaCl module 'load' event
      fires.  This also allows you to use PPB_Messaging.PostMessage() (in C) or
      pp::Instance.PostMessage() (in C++) from within the initialization code in
      your NaCl module.
