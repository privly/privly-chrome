## About ##

Privly is a developing set of browser extensions and applications for usable 
internet content privacy. It allows users to view content on any website, without 
the host site being able to read the content. The Privly extensions support 
"Injectable Applications" (also known as Privly Applications), which are web 
applications viewed within the context of other web applications. These 
applications can be any web application, but they are generally oriented to 
supporting a privacy use case.

For more information on what Privly is, 
[read about us](https://priv.ly/pages/about).

## About this Repository ##

This repository is oriented to cross-platform development of "Injectable 
Applications," which are web applications viewed within the context of other web 
applications. Since injectable applications are not necessarily viewed inside an 
iframe, they also support layout as the top document in the browser.

The two current injectable applications are found in the PlainPost and ZeroBin 
folders. They are currently bundled into the 
[Google Chrome Extension](https://github.com/privly/privly-chrome) and the hosted 
[content server](https://github.com/privly/privly-web).

**For more information** on developing for this repository, read development.md in 
this directory.
